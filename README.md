# PathLib

Brief: Yet another pathing lib.

A simple pathing library that enables an event-driven and customisable approach. 2D pathing can be used in a lot of places, and this library facilitates that by allowing the end-user to only have to provide a couple of required functions in order to harness the full power of 2D pathing.

## Coming in the future (read: checklist)
